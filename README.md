# Basketball-Games-Prediction 

This repo is created to host an ambitious open source project consisting of a prediction framework for NBA games. Users will be able to make predictions for upcoming games and past games. Users will also be able to carry out simulations (predictions) using current and past teams.
The project will also contain a beautiful user interface to allow live interractions with the models and database components.

PS: I am currently working in acquiring the needed datasets.
